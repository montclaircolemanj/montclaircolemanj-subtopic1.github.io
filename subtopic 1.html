 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">This site is a biography of sorts that gives some detailed incite to the evolution of film from the turn of the 20th Century to the present time. As the story of film progresses, of course there is note of the advances in technology to accustomize motion pictures to contemporary audiences. Some of the advances listed here include the inventions by the Lumiere Brothers such as the cinematograph, the introduction of sound and color to films, the rise of television and Cinemascope. It also points out that animation has gone through these same technological shifts as well with its transition from the paper to the computer for instance. </span><br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>The purpose of this site here is to get beginners in filmmaking acquainted with the tools that are necessary to bring their work to life. Some of these tools include the camera, lights, microphones and even non-technological equipment like tripods and monopods. It also tells the reader how each of them function and even gives little tips and tricks these tools could make one's work just right. For example how a filmmaker could use more lights than just the key light and fill light. Attention is also given to post-production tools, or software in this case which they would recommend for processes like editing, audio, effects and animation. While it gives a good idea on what tools to begin your career with, there is no "right way" to do so and concludes that it depends on what you are comfortable with.</small><br>
